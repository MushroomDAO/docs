Of course. This is a critical technical due diligence step. Your ability to deliver a seamless and secure MVP hinges on the maturity and accessibility of these core web technologies.

Here is a dedicated technical analysis document evaluating the capabilities, security, and browser support for both in-browser camera access and WebAuthn fingerprint authentication, based on your request.

### **Technical Feasibility Analysis: In-Browser Hardware Access for the Mycelium MVP**

**To:** Mycelium Protocol DAO, Technical Committee
**From:** [Your Name], Project Lead
**Date:** July 7, 2025
**Subject:** Assessment of Web APIs for Camera-based QR Scanning and Biometric Authentication

#### **1. Executive Summary**

This document provides a technical assessment of two key technologies required for the Mycelium MVP:
1.  **In-browser camera access** for scanning QR codes.
2.  **In-browser biometric authentication** (specifically fingerprint scanning) for securing user actions.

The analysis concludes that both technologies are mature, widely supported by modern mobile browsers, and governed by robust security standards that make them suitable for our project. The primary challenge is not in the *possibility* of using these features, but in their correct and user-friendly implementation.

#### **2. In-Browser Camera Access for QR Code Scanning**

The ability for our web-based MVP to scan a merchant's PromptPay QR code directly in the browser, without forcing an immediate app download, is critical for reducing user friction.

##### **2.1. Core Technology: The `getUserMedia` API**

The primary web standard that enables this functionality is the `MediaDevices.getUserMedia()` method.[1] This JavaScript API allows a web page to request access to a user's media input devices, such as their camera and microphone.[1]

*   **How it Works:** When called, the API prompts the user for permission to use their camera. If permission is granted, it returns a `MediaStream` object, which is essentially a live video feed from the camera. This video stream can then be rendered into a `<video>` element on the webpage and analyzed in real-time by a QR code decoding library.[2, 3]

##### **2.2. Feasibility & Browser Compatibility**

The `getUserMedia` API is a well-established web standard and enjoys excellent support across the vast majority of modern mobile browsers.[1]

*   **Broad Support:** According to `caniuse.com`, the API is supported by Chrome for Android, Safari on iOS (since version 11), Samsung Internet, and Firefox for Android.[4, 5, 6] Global usage statistics show support on over 94% of browsers.[6] This high level of compatibility ensures that our web-based MVP will be accessible to the vast majority of our target users on their mobile devices.

##### **2.3. Security & User Consent Model**

Browser vendors have implemented strict security and privacy controls around this powerful API, which works in our favor by building user trust.[1]

1.  **Secure Context (HTTPS) is Mandatory:** The `getUserMedia` API can **only** be called from a page loaded over a secure connection (HTTPS).[1] Any attempt to use it on an insecure (HTTP) page will fail. This is a fundamental security requirement that prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.[7]
2.  **Explicit User Permission is Required:** A website cannot access the camera silently. The browser will always display a clear, non-bypassable permission prompt to the user, asking if they want to allow the specific website to access their camera.[1] The user must explicitly grant this permission.
3.  **Clear Visual Indicators:** When the camera is active, all modern mobile browsers display a persistent icon in the status bar or address bar, and the device's hardware light (if present) will be activated. This transparency makes it very difficult for a site to access the camera without the user's knowledge.[8]

##### **2.4. Implementation Strategy**

While the `getUserMedia` API provides the video stream, we still need to decode the QR code from that stream. Instead of building a decoder from scratch, we will leverage a well-maintained, open-source JavaScript library.

*   **Recommended Library:** `html5-qrcode` is an excellent choice.[9, 10] It is a full-featured library that handles the entire process: requesting camera permissions, rendering the video feed into a UI element, and decoding multiple barcode formats, including QR codes.[9, 10] It has extensive documentation and is actively maintained.[9, 11, 12]
*   **Alternative:** For more performance-critical applications, `qr-scanner` by Nimiq is a lightweight alternative, though it may require more manual UI integration.[10, 13]

**Conclusion for Camera Access:** The technology to implement in-browser QR code scanning is mature, secure, and widely available. Our MVP can reliably offer this feature to create a frictionless initial payment experience.

#### **3. In-Browser Fingerprint Authentication**

To enhance security for significant actions (e.g., confirming payments, authorizing large top-ups) without adding password friction, we can leverage on-device biometrics like fingerprint scanners.

##### **3.1. Core Technology: WebAuthn (Web Authentication API)**

WebAuthn is a W3C web standard that enables passwordless authentication using public-key cryptography.[7, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] It is the core component of the FIDO2 project.

*   **How it Works:**
    1.  **Registration:** When a user opts-in, the browser instructs the device's secure hardware (the "authenticator," e.g., Android's Keystore, Apple's Secure Enclave) to generate a unique public-private key pair for our website.[14, 21]
    2.  The **private key never leaves the device**. It is securely stored and can only be unlocked by the user's biometric gesture (fingerprint, face) or device PIN.[17, 21]
    3.  The **public key** is sent to our server and associated with the user's account.[21]
    4.  **Authentication:** To confirm a payment, our server sends a unique "challenge" to the browser. The browser passes this to the authenticator. The user authenticates with their fingerprint, which unlocks the private key to sign the challenge. This signed challenge is sent back to our server, which verifies it with the stored public key.[14, 21, 22]

##### **3.2. Security Assessment: A Paradigm Shift from Passwords**

WebAuthn offers a monumental security upgrade over traditional passwords.

1.  **Phishing Resistant:** The cryptographic keys are "scoped" to a specific domain.[20, 21] A key created for `app.mycelium.io` cannot be used to sign a challenge from a phishing site like `app.myceluim.io`, making credential theft via phishing virtually impossible.[17, 19]
2.  **No Server-Side Shared Secrets:** We never store passwords or private keys. Even if our database were breached, there are no credentials to steal that could be used to impersonate users.[17]
3.  **No Replay Attacks:** Each authentication challenge is unique for that specific session, meaning a captured signature cannot be reused by an attacker.[17]

##### **3.3. Feasibility & Browser Compatibility**

WebAuthn is now widely supported across the modern web ecosystem, with global browser support exceeding 95%.[23]

*   **Desktop & Mobile Support:** It is supported by Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox on both desktop and mobile platforms.[23, 24]
*   **Platform Authenticator Support:** Critically for our use case, it supports "platform authenticators" â€“ the biometric sensors built directly into devices.[18, 20, 25, 26] This includes:
    *   **Android:** Fingerprint sensor and screen lock.
    *   **iOS (14.5+):** Touch ID and Face ID.
    *   **Windows 10/11:** Windows Hello (fingerprint, face).
    *   **macOS:** Touch ID.

**Conclusion for Biometric Authentication:** WebAuthn is a highly secure, widely adopted standard that is technically feasible for our MVP. It allows us to provide a user experience that is both more secure and more convenient than traditional PINs or passwords for confirming transactions. The implementation complexity is manageable through the use of dedicated libraries and services.
