## What is Mushroom DAO?

Mushroom DAO is a decentralized organization dedicated to building and launching **new economic paradigms** on the blockchain. Our work explores innovations beyond DeFi by **cultivating new networks and methods for cooperation**. We envision a blockchain that **empowers people and improves lives**, transcending its role as a mere tool for financial speculation.

### Infrastructure
We create AirAccount, SuperPaymaster, SDSS(Standard Decentralized Service System, Rain Computing), and more.
We have AAStar team and CMUBA, who are working on the infrastructure construction and related applications.


### Protocol
We create jLab years ago, researching on **HyperCapital** theoretically after the individual value research and more.
We learn from the Nature and Mycelium a lot, trying to practice the innovations guided by the Nature.
So, we initiate the **Mycelium Protocol**, and run the Mycelium Protocol.

### CMUBRC/CMUBA
We create CMUBA(Chiang Mai University Blockchain Association), a pre-state of CMUBRC(Chiang Mai University Blockchain Research Center, plan), trying to research on academic and industry together.
We publish and working on some topics and papers.

### DAO/Community
We are trying to create a DAO, MushRoom DAO, it is a open community.
MushRoom DAO will initiate the Mycelium Protocol, and run the Mycelium Protocol.
We will create a real organization in Dubai, and run the real organization.

### Company
We invent a new simple way: create a company for efficiency on initiating a DAO.
And help the DAO to run real world business cooperation with benefits sharing.
We call this company HyperCapital, holding the DAO 20% GToken without any revenue.
The only way to get business return is to help the DAO growing and invest the real project in business layer to get return.

## What is Mycelium Protocol?
Mycelium Protocol is a cooperation protocol inspiring by the nature and diversity fungi relations, it is built on the Ethereum blockchain.

## What is the relationship between Mushroom DAO and Mycelium Protocol?
Mushroom DAO is a instance of Mycelium Protocol, and an initial protocol builder.
One is theoretical, the other is practical.

## What we need?
**Complaints and grievances are less effective than taking action.**
Now we need researchers, developers, designers, and more.

But, read the [White Paper](./whitepaper-en.md) first.

## What I can do?
Create some cooperation innovations following the Nature's way like Mycelium.
